<!-- 6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children ( 6 years and younger) 
    or seniors (65 years and older).  
- Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.  
- Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. 
If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.  
Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.  
- Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages. -->
