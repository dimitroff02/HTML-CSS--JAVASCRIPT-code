<!-- 6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, 
    let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. 
    Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;  
- Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.  
- Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code aets done first. -->
